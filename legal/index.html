      <h1>Naptio – Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: 21 August 2025</p>

      <p><strong>Provider:</strong> Fishex Limited of <strong>[Registered Address]</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”).<br/>
         <strong>Product:</strong> Naptio (the “App”).</p>

      <h2>1. Who may use the App</h2>
      <p>You must be an adult (18+) and legally capable of entering a contract. Use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</p>

      <h2>2. What we provide</h2>
      <p>We provide a consumer baby-monitoring application that uses device cameras and microphones and <strong>on-device</strong> AI to surface non-medical insights (e.g., indications of hunger, discomfort, tiredness). The App streams audio/video between your devices using WebRTC with encryption in transit (DTLS-SRTP). Availability and performance depend on your devices, OS/browser, and network (including STUN/TURN infrastructure).</p>

      <h2>3. Critical safety notice — <em>Not a medical device</em></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App and any associated hardware are <strong>not medical devices</strong>, are not intended for diagnosis, treatment, or life-safety, and do not replace adult supervision.</li>
        <li>AI outputs are probabilistic and may be wrong (false negatives/positives). Do <strong>not</strong> rely on the App as the sole means of monitoring a child.</li>
        <li>The App will not detect or prevent medical emergencies (including SIDS). Always follow professional paediatric and safe-sleep guidance.</li>
        <li>You remain solely responsible for your child’s wellbeing and continuous, direct supervision.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Technical limitations</h2>
      <p>The App’s operation can be affected by: device placement (angle, distance, crib bars), lighting, background noise, OS power-saving/permissions, network quality, outages, or third-party services. WebRTC media is encrypted in transit, but no system is 100% secure or available.</p>

      <h2>5. Your responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Place devices securely, out of a child’s reach; keep cables and batteries safe.</li>
        <li>Keep devices charged and software updated; allow required permissions and notifications.</li>
        <li>Test the App and alerts on your setup before use and after updates.</li>
        <li>Obtain consent where you monitor anyone other than your own child, as required by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You must not misuse the App; attempt to access or intercept streams without authorisation; reverse-engineer or circumvent security; use it to monitor individuals unlawfully; or infringe others’ rights.</p>

      <h2>7. Licence and IP</h2>
      <p>We grant you a limited, revocable, non-transferable licence to use the App for personal, non-commercial use. We retain all intellectual-property rights.</p>

      <h2>8. No warranties (consumer rights preserved)</h2>
      <p>Except as required by law, the App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties (including accuracy, uninterrupted operation, or fitness for a particular purpose). Nothing in these Terms affects your non-excludable consumer rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.</p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not exclude or limit liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, nor for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
        <li>Subject to the above and to the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for: (a) indirect, special, or consequential loss; (b) interruption or failure caused by factors outside our reasonable control (device/OS failures, networks, third-party services); (c) reliance on AI insights where reasonable supervision would have avoided harm.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>Browsers, OS vendors, and connectivity infrastructure (e.g., STUN/TURN) are not under our control and their terms may apply separately.</p>

      <h2>11. Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms; material changes will be notified in-app or on our site. Continued use after the effective date means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

      <h2>12. Termination</h2>
      <p>You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for breach, unlawful use, or risk to others.</p>

      <h2>13. Governing law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction (consumers may also bring claims in their local UK courts where applicable).</p>

    <!-- PRIVACY -->
    <section id="privacy" class="section-card" style="margin-top:24px;">
      <h1>Naptio – Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: 21 August 2025</p>

      <p><strong>Controller:</strong> Fishex Limited of <strong>[Registered Address]</strong> • <strong>Contact:</strong> [Support Email]</p>

      <h2>1. What this policy covers</h2>
      <p>This explains what personal data we process, why, and your rights under the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

      <h2>2. What we process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-device audio/video & AI.</strong> Audio/video and AI inference run locally on your devices. Streams are sent device-to-device via WebRTC and encrypted in transit (DTLS-SRTP). We do not store or view your streams on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Connection/telemetry (minimal).</strong> To establish/maintain connections (e.g., via STUN/TURN), we and our processors may receive IP addresses, ports, timestamps, and error/diagnostic events.</li>
        <li><strong>Account/billing/support (if used).</strong> Name, email, purchase data, and support messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Local storage.</strong> Settings you choose to store on your device (e.g., room name, alert preferences).</li>
        <li><strong>Crash/analytics (optional, off by default).</strong> Pseudonymous analytics only if you opt in; disabled by default for services used by or about children.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Purposes and lawful bases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide the App and features</strong> (peer-to-peer streaming, notifications, settings). <em>Lawful basis:</em> contract and/or legitimate interests (service security and functionality). Where legitimate interests involve children’s data, we apply enhanced safeguards and conduct DPIA/LIA.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics, security, and fraud prevention.</strong> <em>Lawful basis:</em> legitimate interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer support and communications.</strong> <em>Lawful basis:</em> contract or legitimate interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing (if any).</strong> <em>Lawful basis:</em> consent (opt-in only; withdraw any time).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Children</h2>
      <p>Because Naptio involves children’s information (e.g., images captured on parental devices), we design with the ICO’s Children’s Code: privacy-by-default, data minimisation, clear parental controls, and no targeted ads to children.</p>

      <h2>5. Sharing and international transfers</h2>
      <p>We do not sell children’s personal data. We may use vetted processors for infrastructure (e.g., TURN relays, support/helpdesk, payments). Where data leaves the UK, we use approved safeguards (UK IDTA/UK Addendum to SCCs or adequacy). A current list of processors is available on request.</p>

      <h2>6. Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We don’t keep your streams.</li>
        <li><strong>Telemetry/diagnostics (if any).</strong> Retained only as long as necessary for troubleshooting and security, then deleted or anonymised.</li>
        <li><strong>Account/support records.</strong> Retained for legally required periods (e.g., accounting and tax) and then deleted or anonymised.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>We use appropriate technical and organisational measures, including encryption in transit (DTLS-SRTP for WebRTC), least-privilege access, and secure development practices. You should also secure your devices (passcodes, updates).</p>

      <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
      <p>You can request access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection. You may also withdraw consent where used. To exercise rights, contact <strong>[Support Email]</strong>. You can complain to the ICO if you are unhappy (ico.org.uk). We follow the UK GDPR principles: lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, security, and accountability.</p>

      <h2>9. Cookies and local storage</h2>
      <p>We use only strictly necessary local storage/cookies to run the App unless you opt into additional analytics.</p>

      <h2>10. Changes</h2>
      <p>We will update this policy from time to time and post the new effective date.</p>
